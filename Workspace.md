# Set up an Azure Machine Learning Workspace (30-35%)
* create an Azure Machine Learning workspace
* configure workspace settings
* manage a workspace by using Azure Machine Learning studio

## Manage data objects in an Azure Machine Learning workspace
* register and maintain datastores
* create and manage datasets

## Manage experiment compute contexts
* create a compute instance
* determine appropriate compute specifications for a training workload
* create compute targets for experiments and training

With a **Machine Learning compute cluster**, you can easily create a single or multi-node compute instance. A Machine Learning compute cluster is the only type supported by Azure Machine Learning studio to associate a Machine Learning designer training pipeline.

**Azure Databricks** is an Apache Spark-based environment in the Azure cloud. It can be used as a target with an Azure Machine Learning pipeline, but you cannot set it as a target in Azure Machine Learning designer.

**Azure HDlnsight** is a platform for big-data analytics. It provides Apache Spark, which can be used to train your model, but you cannot set it as a target in Azure Machine Learning designer.
