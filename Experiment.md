# Run Experiments and Train Models (25-30%)

## Create models by using Azure Machine Learning Designer
* create a training pipeline by using Azure Machine Learning designer
* ingest data in a designer pipeline
* use designer modules to define a pipeline data flow
* use custom code modules in designer

## Run training scripts in an Azure Machine Learning workspace
* create and run an experiment by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK
* configure run settings for a script
* consume data from a dataset in an experiment by using the Azure Machine Learning SDK

## Generate metrics from an experiment run
* log metrics from an experiment run
* retrieve and view experiment outputs
* use logs to troubleshoot experiment run errors

## Automate the model training process
* create a pipeline by using the SDK
* pass data between steps in a pipeline
* run a pipeline
* monitor pipeline runs

The **scikit-learn estimator** provides a simple way of launching an SKLearn training job on a compute target. It is implemented through the scikit-learn class, which can be used to support single-node CPU training.
